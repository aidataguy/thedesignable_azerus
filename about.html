				Azerus&copy; is the blogging platform.. Well the Idea of "Azerus" came up after seeing that there are those big, resource hogger software, which only work good when there are not more than one or 5 plugins. But the performance becomes an issue as soon as you add new feature. You know how it feels right?. So we came up with the idea of making something that would be lightweight and performance driven. We do have plugins, but trust us those you won't feel any performance issue at all. 

				Check out the <a href="/features/">features</a> that Azerus&copy;.

				We are about to roll out our Beta release, which will be non-commercial, but don't worry we will still provide patches and updates for it, as much as for that of Azerus&copy; - Professional.
