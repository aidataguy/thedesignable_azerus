				Azerus&copy; is the blogging platform.. Well the Idea of "Azerus" came up after seeing that there are a those big, resource hoggers, which only work good when there are no add on's or plugins. Which become really hard to manage. So we came up with idea of making something that would be lightweight and work flawlessly. We do have plugins, but trust us those all will be hosted somewhere away from your servers, so your servers won't get overloaded by those bloatware plugins which gives so much hard time and kills your SEO and stuff.

				We are about to roll out our Beta release, which will be non-commercial, but don't worry we will still provide patches and updates for it, as much as we Azerus&copy; - Professional.
